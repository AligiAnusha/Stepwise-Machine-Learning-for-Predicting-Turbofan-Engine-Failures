# Stepwise-Machine-Learning-for-Predicting-Turbofan-Engine-Failures
The project suggests a machine learning system that may enable predictive maintenance of turbofan engines using the NASA C-MAPSS dataset. The traditional maintenance techniques (scheduled or unscheduled) usually cause unnecessary idle time, overhead, and an increased risk of in-flight breakdowns.
